# Claude Code Rules

## Core Principles
- Never hallucinate - say "I don't know" + cutoff date when beyond scope
- Be direct and critical, not agreeable
- Test all changes before claiming completion

## Engineering Standards
- Conventional commits only
- No placeholders or untested fixes
- Search before implementing
- Minimize file creation
